# Buku
Buku was a project I started after my fourth semester to learn and explore Vue 3. The idea was simple, a simple web interface to store and manage the digital copies of the books with ease.
<br>
Recently, Nuxt 3 was released, and like always, I wanted to try it. I was thinking about project ideas, when I came across my buku project, and I thought that I could port buku to Nuxt 3, and see how it goes. I thought it would also be a great addition to my [DevJournal blog series](https://blog.pycz.dev/series/dev-journals), which I recently started.

# Status of the Project
I had initially planned to complete the project in two days, but it just took me two days to figure out hosting (was trying to host nuxt 3 on edge, but ended up using serverless after two days of fails :) )
<br>
This project helped me to create my first PRs of the year into the VueJS ecosystem, but IMO, Nuxt 3 is quite new and the ecosystem is yet to develop, Since it's almost a week now since I started the project, I am putting this project on hold to work on another project. I would be back when some the underlying libraries the project uses, mature.
